The smart contract we'll implement is a Smart Contract that represents a Corportion. Similar to how corporations operate, our smart contract assigns roles: Owners : Shareholders of the company who have limited access. Master : The president/CEO of the company with full access. Admins : Both Owners and Master together as a group.
Features:
Master has the right to add owner with addOwner() and remove owner with removeOwner().
Admins (owner & master) have the right to transfer their share to anyone using the giveShare() function.
Admins (owner & master) have the right to transfer their share to one of the owners(not master) using the addShare() function.
checkIfOwner() returns whether the given address is owner or not.
getMaster() returns the address of the master.
getOwners() returns the list of owner addresses.
Users who are not in the boundary of Admins cannot transfer their share but can still receive.
